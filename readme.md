# ELM Lunch talks by FB

Why the heck do I ‚ù§ ELM so much?

Good question. I created this repo to try to share some of the experiences of creating stuff with ELM. And then to share the experience of maintaining stuff with ELM.

## Available sessions

* [Day 1 - Simple architecture + Mandatory Hello world][Day1]
* [Day 2 - A walkthrough some of ELM's examples][Day2]
* [Day 3 - The MVP for an editable table][Day3]

[Day1]: Day1/
[Day2]: Day2/
[Day3]: Day3/
